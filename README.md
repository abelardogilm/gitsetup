Shell script to generate new repo local and on git server, and connect it

## Configure
Make sure you save it somewhere on your PATH, or load this folder on it. If you don't have a directory for custom shell scripts on your PATH, you can save it in ~/bin and then add that to your PATH by editing ~/.bash_profile as follows:
```
PATH=$PATH:~/bin
export PATH
```
